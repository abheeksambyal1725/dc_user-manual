7. Python DSL to work with DeepCortex
#####################################

DSL Overview
============

DC Lib provides a set of convenient methods for DeepCortex API. The methods have well documented code.
At the same time DC Lib can be used just like any python package: in some other Python package (as a library),
imported in a python program and executed from the command line or a Jupyter notebook.


.. _DSL_installation:

7.1 Installation
================

First it is needed to get a URL of storage which is used to publish **dclib**. so contact support.

Install dclib of a specific version (*~=* is used to get the latest version with fixes):

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install dclib~=<release-version> --extra-index-url "<storage_url>"

For future reference you can:

- set the url via command line if you haven't set up *extra-index-url* before

.. code:: bash

    $ pip config set install.extra-index-url '<storage_url>'

- configure the url in **pip.conf** by adding a new *extra-index-url*

.. code:: bash

    [install]
    extra-index-url = <previously set urls>
                      <storage_url>
    timeout = 20

**On Unix:** by default pip looks into *$HOME/.config/pip/pip.conf* for configuration data.
If you have set the conf and yet if the pip conf is not being picked please check
that **pip.conf** is in the right home directory for the user. e.g. */root* or */home/user*

.. container:: fillme

    TODO: describe other possible options to install via pip or/and conda command

7.2 Usage
=========

If you have an account on DeepCortex and want to gain access to DeepCortex library,
you need to sign up for the account:

.. code-block:: python

    import deepcortex
    deepcortex.login('user', 'password')

If you have an account on custom DeepCortex installation and want to gain access to your assets there,
pass the installation URL as *deepcortex_url* keyword parameter in *deepcortex.login()* method:

.. code-block:: python

    import deepcortex
    deepcortex.login('user', 'password',
                     deepcortex_url="http://<custom_deepcortex_url>:9000/")

Also check :ref:`what_are_package_repositories` section to use custom operators or some other code from user packages
