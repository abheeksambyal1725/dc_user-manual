3.1. What are DeepCortex (DC) Pipelines?
========================================

DeepCortex Pipeline is 1 or more DC Operators stitched together to perform a set of tasks
either sequentially or in a task-parallel manner based on the construed DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).
In DeepCortex, the Pipelines are created from either the Compose Module (Canvas), or from the Code Moule (IDE).

3.2 How to construct Pipelines in DeepCortex?
=============================================
In DeepCortex, users can construct/compose pipelines using 1 of 2 methods:

a. From Compose/ Canvas
=======================
To construct a new pipeline from canvas, click on the “Create Pipeline” button as shown in the screenshot below.

.. figure:: images/create.png

Once a new pipeline is constructed, user can start pulling the operators from the drop down in the left panel,
onto the main pipeline canvas. The operators in the left panel are organized by “Operator Categories”.
User can click on any Operator Category to see the list of Operators under the selected Category.
The number depicted next to each Operator category represents the count of unique operators in that category.
The user can also use the search feature to search for an operator by name.
Below screenshot shows the list of Operators under the Operator Category “Transformers”.

.. figure:: images/transformers_category.png

As shown in the below screenshot, users can find more information about the Operators
(version, description, expected inputs, expected outputs, configuration parameters) by clicking on the info
icon shown next to the operator name or by clicking on the icon on the operator interface
when user drags the operator on to the canvas.

.. figure:: images/operator_info.png

To use an Operator in the pipeline, drag the operator from the left panel onto the main Canvas workspace.
Every Operator in DeepCortex will have 3 components (as shown in the below screenshot):

.. figure:: images/canvas_with_operators.png

1. one or more Input(s) – to connect to upstream operators
    a. input(s) marked in red is a “required” input(s)
    b. input(s) marked in blue are “optional” input(s)

2. one or more Output(s) – to connect to downstream operators

3. control options – to control/view various options for the operators
    a. information: provides additional information about operator (version, input definition, output definition, parameter definition)
    b. configuration parameter: allows users to view/edit default configuration parameters for the operator
    c. delete: remove operator from canvas

To learn more about Configuring the parameters of an operator, please refer to :ref:`how_to_configure_operators_in_pipelines` section.

Operators can be connected to each other by following the below steps:

1. Click on the output node of the Operator you want to connect from

2. Holding down the mouse button, drag your mouse to one of the input nodes of the Operator you want to connect to.
   This will create a “connector” between the two operators as shown in the below screenshot.

3. Release the mouse button, after the connector reaches the input node of downstream operator

b. From Code (using Notebooks)

3.3 How to configure Operators in a Pipeline?
=============================================

Clicking the operator configuration control on the Operator icon brings up the configuration pop-up,
which allows users to view/modify any of the operator’s configuration parameters.
The below screenshot shows the configuration pop-up for an example operator.
For additional information on the configuration parameters, users can also hover over the (?) icon next
to each parameter name in the pop-up.

.. _how_to_execute_pipelines: 

3.4 How to execute Pipelines in DeepCortex (Lab Module)?
========================================================

In DeepCortex, pipelines can be executed in 1 of 2 modes:

a. Non-Interactive Mode 
=======================
In this mode, the entire pipeline is executed as a single job.
To run the pipeline, user has to click the “RUN” button on the top panel, as shown in the below screenshot.

.. figure:: images/run_pipeline.png

b. Interactive Mode
===================
In this mode, the user can pick and choose which operator(s) should be executed and
only those are executed as a single job. When a user chooses to execute a single operator,
all the upstream operators that are directly or indirectly connected to the selected operator will also get executed.

    TODO: add a section that shows “Best Practice Approach for Model Building: Rapid Experimentation”

Each pipeline that is Run/executed in DeepCortex (either in Interactive or Non-Interactive mode) results
in a new asset type called “Experiment”.

All Experiments (Running, Completed, Cancelled) can be viewed in the “LAB” module of DeepCortex.
Once an Experiment completes, user can see the results of the Experiment by clicking on the “Results” module
of the Experiment in the main panel. User can also refer to the “Pipeline” that was executed as part of
the Experiment by clicking the “Pipeline” module for the Experiment. Below screenshots shows the Pipeline
and Results module for a sample Experiment that completed successfully.
